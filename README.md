Aquilon Importer Module for Icinga Web 2
========================================

This is a very simple module that gets all Aqulion hosts on site at RAL and imports them into Icinga.
Some on disk caching is used for this, as the profiles can be relatively large - and therefore it can take
a little while to download them all.

This is really designed for the Quattor/Aquilon implementation at STFC RAL - but if you are able to make
use of it, please do!
